 *                     InitTTY fixed for PLAIN. -- DISTRIBUTED
 * 06.02.95 -- 3.05.66 DisplayLine() does now clipping to reduce coredump-
 *                     frequency. Window size is adapted to the display that
 *                     types input, to reduce multi-user confusion. Scrollback
 *                     mode still may get the wrong size.
 * 07.02.95 -- 3.05.67 WinRewrite() also needs to clip. Users without unix
 *                     account, but with screen password allowed. Chacl
 *                     allows password change, su prompts for user name too.
 * 01.03.95 -- 3.05.68 Leaving a window may now cause a resize to match a 
 *                     remaining display. Simple ESC-CR fix in the vt100
 *                     state machine.
 * 26.03.95 -- 3.05.69 Markroutine() needs to resize the window to avoid 
 *                     coredumps, just like WinProcess() already does.
 *                     More NEED_ flags added in comm.c to avoid coredumps.
 * 04.04.95 -- 3.06.02 Simple ESC-CR fix in the vt100 state machine.
 *                     Now compiles again with all extras disabled.
 *                     Zombie resurrect added. defc1, defgr, defkanji
 *                     added. Screen now replies to a secondary DA
 *                     query. Some missing NEED_XXX added in comm.c.
 *                     Better default tty permissions/group test.
 *                     More AUX support, now compiles with POSIX.
 *                     Function keycodes xtermified (F11, F12).
 *                     Paste bug fixed (only worked with KANJI).
 *                     Check bcopy before memcpy/memmove.
 *                     FindSocket code much fixed & improved.
 * 10.04.95 -- 3.05.70 Display_displays() now shows the users permissions on 
 *                     the currently displayed window, this is easier than a 
 *                     full featured lsacl, but also helps. chacl can now copy
 *                     users, but we need to copy windows.
 * 26.04.95 -- 3.05.71 Multi digit screen numbers in utmp. MakeWindow() now
 *                     echoes what it does, just like RemakeWindow() when
 *                     'verbose on' (default off).
 *                     `screen -ls myname/' will find own(!) non-multi sessions.
 *                     Command line option -q improved and documented.
 *                     'debug off' also shuts attacher debugging off now.
 * 03.05.95 -- 3.05.72 'connect' command bugfixed. colon prompt improved.
 *                     open(O_NONBLOCK) does not work on 4.1.3, using O_NDELAY.
 *                     There are writes to exp_wid2chan[-1], XXX I just added 
 *                     fillers to the mux structure, please debug this ASAP! 
 *                     WindowByName() prefers exact matches now. Esc forwarding
 *                     from Frontend to Backend suppressed unless specified.
 * 26.06.95 -- 3.05.73 Improving the combination of dflag and rflag: If both
 *                     are set, a screen session is reattached, regardless
 *                     if it was previously detached or attached elseewhere.
 *                     "screen -D -RR" is thus most powerful: Give me my screen
 *                     session here and now. No matter, if this means creating
 *                     a new session (due to the second R without warning 
 *                     message), detching the session first (and due to the
 *                     capitalised D logging out), or simply attaching to it.
 * 13.07.95 -- 3.05.74 Markroutine learned new join mode: comma seperated.
 *                     Can disable the detach feature from config.h.
 *                     Configure.in now calls etc/toolcheck. Password is no
 *                     longer a static array.
 * 30.07.95 -- 3.05.75 Karl Heuer wants to install with a relative symlink.
 *                     Command line option -k removed (try -t).
 * 31.08.95 -- 3.06.03 Color support, digraph command, code

 *                     SIGHUP. w_curchar->w_rend, lintified.

 *                     Very visible cursor added. vbell sequence
 *                     \Eb added. _delay for terminfo libs added

 *                     Braille code almost completely reworked.
 *                     New ProcessInput() makes "command command"
